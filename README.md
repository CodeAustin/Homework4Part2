# Homework 4 Part 2: jQuery Input Validation

This project is a dynamic webpage that allows users to generate a customizable multiplication table based on four numerical inputs: minimum and maximum values for rows and columns. The page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The minimum values should always be set first since there is a validation in check that ensures that the min and maxes of the sliders do not go past the limited value so that (max < min) and vice-versa. 

The page will default to a 5x5 table with values of 0-5 on both axies.

Note: THIS WAS NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED EXPECT MESSY DOCUMENTATION

Major bug that I CANNOT FIGURE OUT IN THE CSS is an issue where overflow-x is not properly covered up and I have no idea how to solve this issue.

Was there probably an easier method to implementation probably but I am out of time.
